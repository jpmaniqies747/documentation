You can use the npm search bar to locate packages for your projects. The search function leverages information from a package's title, description, readme, and keywords, powered by OpenSearch. Results are displayed based on keyword matching from these fields, without subjective ranking criteria. However, adjustments are applied to deprioritise spammy or recently published packages to ensure search neutrality. Please note that newly published packages may take up to one-two week to appear in the search results. Additionally, deprecated packages are excluded from the search results to enhance the user experience.

## Searching for a package

1. In the search bar, type a search term and press **Enter**. As you type, possible choices will appear.

2. The results display an approximate count of packages found, accompanied by a dropdown menu for sorting options. Users can refine their search by choosing from sorting methods such as keyword matching (Default), download counts, most dependents, and last published date.
